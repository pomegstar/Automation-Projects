# Google Docs to PDF Auto-Save Script

ðŸŒŸ **Tired of Manually Converting Google Docs to PDFs? I've Got the Solution!** ðŸŒŸ

Are you constantly editing your Google Docs, but frustrated by the need to repeatedly convert them into PDFs? Does the process of downloading and saving the latest PDF version every time feel time-consuming and repetitive? ðŸ˜£

I understand your pain! The need for updated PDFs can be a real hassle when you're dealing with live, dynamic documents (like your Resume) in Google Drive. But what if there was a tool that could **automatically update your PDFs** whenever you make changes in your Google Docs?

âœ¨ **Here's the solution:**
This folder contains a Google Apps Script that automatically converts a Google Docs file to PDF and saves it to the same Google Drive folder. The script can be set to run on a periodic trigger, ensuring that the PDF version is always updated when changes are made to the Google Docs file.

## Features

- Automatically exports Google Docs files as PDFs.
- Saves the converted PDF in the same folder as the original Google Docs file.
- Replaces the old PDF file with the new version to ensure the latest changes are reflected.
- Can be configured to run at specific intervals (e.g., every 5 minutes, hourly, etc.).

## Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to set up and run the auto-save Google Docs to PDF script:

### 1. Open the Google Docs File
- Open the Google Docs file you want to automatically save as a PDF in your Google Drive.

### 2. Open the Apps Script Editor
- In the Google Docs file, go to **Extensions > Apps Script**.

### 3. Add the Script
- Copy AutoDocsToPDF.gs file's script and paste it in the editor. Remove any code from the editor before pasting (if any).
- Replace ```'Your-google-docs-document-ID'``` in line **5** with your actual Google Docs document ID (you can get it from the URL).
- Look at the URL in the address bar of your browser. The URL will look something like this:
```https://docs.google.com/document/d/1A2B3C4D5E6F7G8H9I/edit```
In this example, the Document ID is the long string between /d/ and /edit. So, for the URL above, the Document ID is:
```1A2B3C4D5E6F7G8H9I```
- After replacing ```'Your-google-docs-document-ID'``` **Save** the project.

### 4. Set Up Triggers
- To automatically save the document as a PDF, you can set a time-based trigger:
  1. In the Apps Script Editor, click the clock icon (Triggers).
  2. Click **+ Add Trigger** in the lower right.
  3. Set the following options:
     - **Choose which function to run**: `autoSaveToPDF`
     - **Choose which deployment should run**: `Head`
     - **Select event source**: `Time-driven`
     - **Select type of time-based trigger**: Select the frequency you want (e.g., every 5 minutes, hourly, etc.)
  4. Save the trigger.

### 5. Testing the Script
- Make changes to the Google Docs file and wait for the trigger to run based on your chosen schedule.
- The PDF file will automatically be saved/updated in the same folder as the Google Docs file.

## Customization

If you want to add more features or modify the script, you can:
- Customize the naming convention of the generated PDF.
- Add other metadata (such as date or versioning) to the PDF file name.
